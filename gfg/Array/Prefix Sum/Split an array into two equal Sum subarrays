/*Given an array of integers greater than zero, find if it is possible to split it in two subarrays 
(without reordering the elements), such that the sum of the two subarrays is the same. Print the two subarrays.*/

//THIS IS NOT SOLVED USING PREFIX SUM, BUT STILL THIS QUESTION IS PART OF THIS HEIRARCHY BEACUSE THERE 
//EXISTS A SIMILAR QUESTION IN THIS HEIRARCHY FOR SPLITTING ARRAY INTO 3 EQUAL SUM PARTS WHICH IS SOLVED USING PREFIX SUM.

//Approach :-
/*An Efficient solution is to first compute the sum of the whole array from left to right.
Now we traverse array from right and keep track of right sum, left sum can be computed by 
subtracting current element from whole sum.
Time Complexity : O(n)
Auxiliary Space : O(1)
