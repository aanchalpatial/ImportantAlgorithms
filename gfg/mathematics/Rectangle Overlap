/*LEETCODE 836
A rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are
the coordinates of its top-right corner.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive.  To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner
or edges do not overlap.

Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether they overlap.

//NOTE : If any 2 diagonal points of rectangle are given we can find other 2 points from them as well or in 
//other word, any 2 diagonal points are enough to represent a rectangle in 2d-graph
