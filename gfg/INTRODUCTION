//1) Data Structure and their equivalents in C++ STL
	
	//1) Hash : unordered_set, unordered_map
	//2) Linked List : forward_list, list
	//3) Stack : Stack
	//4) Queue : queue
	//5) Balanced BST : set, map
	//6) Heap : priority_queue


//2) Does in-place mean constant space complexity?

No. By definition, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure.

The tricky part is that space is used by many actors, not only by data structures. The classical example is to use
recursive function without any auxiliary data structures.

Is it in-place? Yes.
Is it constant space? No, because of recursion stack.

//3) Fast I/O in c++
-> added the two lines below in main()
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); 
cin.tie(NULL); 
-> use "\n" instead of endl

//4) Boost Library
Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. 
For example, they are helpful for handling large numbers having range beyond the long long, long double data type (2^64) in C++.
-> We can use any precision with the help of cpp_int data type if we are not sure about how much precision is needed in future.
It automatically converts the desired precision at the Run-time.
#include <boost/multiprecision/cpp_int.hpp> 
using namespace boost::multiprecision; 
cpp_int boost_factorial(int num) 
{ 
    cpp_int fact = 1; 
    for (int i=num; i>1; --i)     
        fact *= i; 
    return fact; 
}


//5) EPSILON
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    /*Epsilon is machine dependent constant such that epsilon is the smallest possible value for 1+epsilon != 1
    OR
    Machine Epsilon is a machine-dependent floating point value that provides an upper bound on 
    relative error due to rounding in floating point arithmetic. 
    Mathematically, for each floating point type, it is equivalent to the difference between 1.0 and 
    the smallest representable value that is greater than 1.0.*/
    
    //finding machine epsilon
    
    float e = 0.1;
    float prev_epsilon;
    while(1+e!=1){
        prev_epsilon = e;
        e/=2;
    }
    cout<<"Epsilon for this machine is : "<<prev_epsilon<<endl;
    
	return 0;
}
