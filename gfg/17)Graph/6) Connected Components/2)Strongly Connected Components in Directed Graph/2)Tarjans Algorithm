//ARTICULATION POINT (or CUT VERTICES) : 
/*articulations points in a graph are those vertices removing which leads to increase in the number of strongly connected components

For connected graph, an articulation point is a vertec removing which disconnects the graph
For disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a vertex removing which increases number of connected components.

Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a connected network â€“ single points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more components.

//kosaraju's algorithm takes 2 traversal of graph, to find SCC, whereas tarjan's algorithm find SCC in 1 traversal of graph only
