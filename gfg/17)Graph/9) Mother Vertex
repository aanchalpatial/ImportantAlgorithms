//Problem : Find the smallest Mother vertex in a directed graph. A mother vertex in a graph G = (V,E) is a vertex v such
//that all other vertices in G can be reached by a path from v.
/*
A Naive approach : O(V(E+V)) time
A trivial approach will be to perform a DFS/BFS on all the vertices and find whether we can reach all the vertices 
from that vertex. This approach takes O(V(E+V)) time, which is very inefficient for large graphs.

If there exist mother vertex (or vertices), then one of the mother vertices is the last finished vertex in DFS.
(Or a mother vertex has the maximum finish time in DFS traversal).
A vertex is said to be finished in DFS if a recursive call for its DFS is over, i.e., all descendants of 
the vertex have been visited.
Algorithm :-
1) Do DFS traversal of the given graph. While doing traversal keep track of last finished vertex ‘v’. This step takes O(V+E) time.
2) If there exist mother vertex (or vetices), then v must be one (or one of them). Check if v is a mother vertex
by doing DFS/BFS from v. This step also takes O(V+E) time.
