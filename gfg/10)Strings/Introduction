//Strings is a special data structure because its charcters are bound to be one of the 256(i.e ascii) values possible.
//Most efficient way to sort a string is to use cound sort beacuse strings has limited range. Thus the fastest we can sort a string is
//linear time.

//APPLICATION:
//1) Given a string, check if they are an anagram of each other in LINEAR time.
//Solution : Use hashmap

//2) Given a string, find the leftmost character that repeats in LINEAR time and 1 TRAVERSAL OF ARRAY.
