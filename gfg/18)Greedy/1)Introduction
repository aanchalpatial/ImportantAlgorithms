Greedy Approach is used in Optimization problems such as maximising or minimizing something.

Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most
obvious and immediate benefit.

So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are best fit for Greedy.

In general, the Greedy Algorithm can be applied to solve a problem if it satisfies the below property:
At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.

If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms 
are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. But Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied.

Applications: 
Activity Selection Problem, 
Fractional Knapsack, 
Job Sequencing, 
Huffman Coding, 
Prim's, Kruskal's for MST
Djikstra's for shortest path.
              
Also used to find close to optimal solutions for NP Hard Problems such as Travelling Salesman Problem.
