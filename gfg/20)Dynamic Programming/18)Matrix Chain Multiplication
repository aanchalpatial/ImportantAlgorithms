//Given a sequence of matrices, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together.
//The problem is not actually to perform the multiplications, but merely to decide in which order to perform the multiplication.

/*APPROACH :
Because matrix multiplication is associative, no matter how we parenthesize the product, the result will be the same.
However, the order in which we parenthesize the product affects the number of simple arithmetic operations needed to
compute the product, or the EFFICIENCY overall.
