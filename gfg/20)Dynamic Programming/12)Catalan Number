/*CATALAN NUMBERS :
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-nth-catalan-number/
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/applications-of-catalan-numbers/

The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, …

There are 2 formulas to find nth catalan numbers :
1) Catalan(n) = 1/(n+1) * 2nCn
Above formula reduces to : Catalan(n) = (k=2)to(n)PI((n+k)/k) for all n>=0
Time complexity of 1st implementation is O(n).

2) Catalana(n) = (i=0)to(n)SIGMA(Catalan(i)*Catalan(n-i)) ; Base case : Catalan(0) = 1
Time complexity of 2nd implementation is O(n2)

Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in many interesting counting problems like following :-
1) Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys 
//https://github.com/ap0996/ImportantAlgorithms/blob/master/gfg/15)%20Binary%20Search%20Tree/12)BST%20Construction/2)Unique%20Binary%20Search%20Trees

2) Number of different Unlabeled & Labeled Binary Trees can be there with n nodes.

3) Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. 
   For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).

4) Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has 
   either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves

/*Problem Statement 2 :
Count different UNLABELED & LABELED possible Binary Trees with given n keys.
*/
/*Approach : 
1) A Binary Tree is unlabeled if nodes are not assigned any label.
   Distinct Unlabeled Binary Trees with n keys = Distinct BST with n keys = countBST(n)
   
2) To count labeled trees, we can use above count for unlabeled trees. The idea is simple, every unlabeled tree with n nodes
   can create n! different labeled trees by assigning different permutations of labels to all nodes.
   Distinct Labeled Binary Trees with n keys = countBST(n) * n!
