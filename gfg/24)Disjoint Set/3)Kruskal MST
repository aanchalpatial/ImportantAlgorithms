/*
Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices
together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree 
with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree
A minimum spanning tree has (V â€“ 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph.
There are 2 algorithm to find Minimum Spanning Tree: Prims's & Kruskal's Algorithm
Prim's Algorithm Studied here : 

Applications: Network design., CLuster Ananlysis & Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems.

*/

//Kruskal's Algorithm
/*Algorithm:
1. Sort all the edges in increasing order of their weight.
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, 
   include this edge. Else, discard it.
3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
