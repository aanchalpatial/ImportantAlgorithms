// stl: queue <int> g; functions: push(), pop(), size(), front(), back(), empty()

//Applications: 
//->Synchronization between slow & fast devices ( queue is used as buffer)
//->In OS: Semaphores, FCFS scheduling, spooling in keyboard
//-> In routers to manage slow and fast networks together

//Variations: 
//1) Dequeu - Implemente using linked list
//2) Priority Queue - Implemented using heap
//3) Double ended priority queue - Implemented using self balancing BST

//Queue Implementations: 
//1) Using array : In naive implementation, enqueue is O(n) & dequeue is O(1). To achieve O(1) in all operations of queue we 
// use CIRCULAR array.
//2) Using linked list
