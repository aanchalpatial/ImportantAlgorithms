//Detect Loop in Singly Linked List
//Method 1) Naive approach: O(n^2)
//for every ith node we check if its next node has same address as one of the 0 to i-1 nodes, If yes then there is a loop.

//Method 2) If modification in linked list structure is allowed, we add a visited flag in linked list definition and if an
//already visited node is again visited then we say linked list has a loop in O(n) time and extra space visited flag on every node
struct Node{
    int key;
    bool visited;
    Node *next;
    Node(int x){
        key = x;
        next = NULL;
        visited = false;
    }
};

//Method 3) In this method instead of modifiying sturcture of linked list , we modify pointers of linked list
//O(n) time and O(1) space, but MODIFIES the linked list(doesn't remains the same).
//Approach: We use a dummy node. while traversing the linked list for every node, after saving the next node point the 
//next pointer of current node to dummy node. And if current node is already pointing to the dummy node, there exists a loop.

//***FLOYD DETECTION METHOD or The tortoise and hare method*** (very popular algo, best solution availabe for loop detection)
//Approach: We maintain 2 pointers i.e slow and fast. If there is a loop in linked list then these 2 will definately meet(ANYWHERE in loop)
//and if not then fast pointer will reach end .

/*APPROACH:
Step 1: Detect loop using flyod algo
Step 2: Move slow to the beggining and retain fast at the meeting point
Step: Now move slow and fast one by one (AT SAME SPEEd) ,then slow and fast will now meet at the starting point of loop
