/*Why mergesort is preferred for linked list ??
->In Linked list, we can insert items in the middle in O(1) extra space and O(1) time. 
Therefore merge operation of merge sort can be implemented WITHOUT EXTRA SPACE for linked lists.
->Quick Sort requires a lot RANDOM ACCESS thus the overhead increases for quick sort.
Merge sort accesses data sequentially and the need of random access is low.
