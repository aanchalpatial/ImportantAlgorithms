//Problem 1 : Given two numbers represented by two lists, write a function that returns the sum list.

//There are *** 2 variation *** to this question based on the fact that whether number is represented from start to end ot end to start.
//1) List1: 5->6->3  // represents number 365
//2) List: 5->6->3  // represents number 563

//Variation 1 : O(m+n) time & O(1) space
//https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-two-numbers-represented-by-linked-lists/
/*
Approach: Traverse both lists and One by one pick nodes of both lists and add the values. If the
sum is more than 10 then make carry as 1 and reduce sum. If one list has more elements than the other
then consider remaining values of this list as 0.

//Varation 2 : 2 ways to solve this variation

//Method 1 : Using Recursion
//https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/description/
//https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-of-two-linked-lists/
//O(m+n) time & O(n) space
/*
Following are the steps.
1) Calculate sizes of given two linked lists.
2) If sizes are same, then calculate sum using recursion. Hold all nodes in recursion call stack till the rightmost node, 
  calculate the sum of rightmost nodes and forward carry to the left side.
3) If size is not same, then follow below steps:
….a) Calculate difference of sizes of two linked lists. Let the difference be diff
….b) Move diff nodes ahead in the bigger linked list. Now use step 2 to calculate the sum of the smaller list
    and right sub-list (of the same size) of a larger list. Also, store the carry of this sum.
….c) Calculate the sum of the carry (calculated in the previous step) with the remaining left sub-list of a larger list.
    Nodes of this sum are added at the beginning of the sum list obtained the previous step.

//Method 2 : Reversing lists
//https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-two-numbers-represented-by-linked-lists-set-3/?ref=rp
//O(m+n) time & O(1) space
/*
Following are the steps:

Reverse List L1.
Reverse List L2.
Add the nodes of both the lists iteratively.
Reverse the resultant list and return its head.
