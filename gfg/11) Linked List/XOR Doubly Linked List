/*
A MEMORY EFFICIENT Doubly Linked List: In the XOR linked list, instead of storing actual memory addresses, every node stores
the XOR of addresses of previous and next nodes.
 While traversing the list we need to remember the address of the previously accessed node in order to calculate the next nodeâ€™s address.
 For example when we are at node C, we must have address of B. XOR of add(B) and npx of C gives us the add(D).
