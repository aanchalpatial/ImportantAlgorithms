//The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, …

//Recursive Solution: Exponential Time
Catalan numbers satisfy the following recursive formula.
C_0 = 1 & C_(n+1) = Sigmai=0ton( C_i*C_(n-i) ) for n>=0


//Better Solution
//We can also use the below formula to find nth catalan number in O(n) time.
C_n = 1/(n+1)  *  2nCn

/*
1) Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. 
For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).

2) Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys

3) Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with
n+1 leaves.

4) Number of different Unlabeled Binary Trees can be there with n nodes
