//used to represent HEIRARCHIAL data
//previously studied data structures were all linear such as arrays, linked list, stack and queue whereas tree is NON LINEAR

//descendants of a given node:- every node that lies in the subtree rooted with given node except itself. A descendant refers to any
//element that is connected lower down the hierarchy tree – no matter how many levels lower.
//ancestor-: An ancestor is any element which is connected further up in the hierarchy tree – no matter how many levels higher

//Applications:- binary search tree, binary heap(used to implement priority queue), B & B+ Trees, spanning & shortest path in computer
//networks, parsing in compilers

//Variation of Tree:
//->Trie : used to implement dictionaries
//->suffix tree : used in fastest possible pattern searching
//binary index tree : range queries
//->segment tree : range queries


//A Binary Tree Node structure
struct Node{
    int key;
    Node *left;
    Node *right;
    
    Node(int x){
        key = x;
        left = NULL;
        right = NULL;
    }
};

/*Types of Binary Tree

1) Full(or Strict) Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children i.e a full binary tree is a binary tree in which
all nodes except leaves have two children.
In a Full Binary, number of leaf nodes is number of internal nodes plus 1
A full binary tree with n leaves contains 2n-1 nodes

2)Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level
and the last level has all keys as left as possible 

3)Perfect Binary Tree: A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves
are at the same level.
A Perfect Binary Tree of height h has 2h – 1 node.

4)Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes.
Balanced Binary Search trees are performance wise good as they provide O(log n) time for search, insert and delete.
Eg: AVL Trees & Red Black Trees

5)Skewed (or pathological or degenerate) tree A Tree where every internal node has one child. 
Such trees are performance-wise same as linked list.
