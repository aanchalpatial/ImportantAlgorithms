//sort() stl can be used to sort CONTAINERS that allow random access such as arrays, vectors & deques.
/*sort(first_parameter, second_parameter, comparison_function) where first_parameter is the iterator to the first element of container 
and second_parameter is the iterator AFTER the last element of the container. Third parameter is optional and is used to define the order 
of sorting the conatiner, eg: default order is increasing and we use "greater<int>" to reverse the order of sorting to decreasing or we 
can create a new function specify our own order of sorting.
*/
//sort() stl takes 0(nlogn) on average & worst cases. It is a hybrid of quicksort, heapsort and insertion sort, also known as introsort.

/*stable_sort() stl for stable sorting of containers
Bubble, Insertion & Merge Sort are stable.
Selection, Quick & Heap Sort are unstable.
Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal keys (i.e. values).
 That is, a sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key and with 
 R appearing before S in the original list, R will appear before S in the sorted list.

//INSERTION SORT: This sorting algorithm is the best sorting algorithm when the array to be sorted is SMALL. It also beats quicksort in 
//case the array is small. Recursive algo such as merge sort & quicksort perform poor when the array size is below a certain threshold.
//In Place, Stable, Best Case: When array is sorted & worst case when array is reverse sorted

//MERGE SORT: Not In Place in typical implementation( requires 0(n) space), well suited for linked list, used in external sorting
// External sorting is a class of sorting algorithms that can handle massive amounts of data. External sorting is required 
// when the data being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a computing device (usually RAM) and instead they 
// must reside in the slower external memory, usually a disk drive.

// ** SPECIAL CASES **
//Sort Binary Array: Partition function of Quicksort
//Array with 3 values: 3 way partitioning i.e dutch flag algorithm
//Array of size n and small ranged values: Count sort
//Array of size n and range is of size n^2 or n^3: Radix Sort
//Array of uniformly distributed data over a range: Bucket Sort
//When memory writes are costly: selection sort, even better algo: cycle sort
//when only adjacent swaps allowed: Bubble sort
//When array size is small OR array is already(or almost) sorted OR all elements are identical: INSERTION SORT
/*when available extra space is less: selection, insertion & bubble sort don't use extra space BUT shall sort doesn't use extra space and 
is 0(n*((logn)^2)) time*/
/*The array has this property that every element in array is at most k distance from its position in sorted array
where k is a positive integer smaller than size of array: Heap Sort with time 0(nlogk) */
//External sorting: Merge Sort
//Paraller sorting:  Mergesort & quicksort since they are divide & conquer algos
