To find union of two sorted arrays, follow the following merge procedure :

1) Use two index variables i and j, initial values i = 0, j = 0
2) If arr1[i] is smaller than arr2[j] then print arr1[i] and increment i.
3) If arr1[i] is greater than arr2[j] then print arr2[j] and increment j.
4) If both are same then print any of them and increment both i and j.
5) Print remaining elements of the larger array.
