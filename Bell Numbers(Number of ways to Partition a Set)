/* Bell(n) =  Sigma k=0 to n for S(n,k) 
Let S(n, k) be total number of partitions of n elements into k sets
Value of S(n, k) :Stirling Number can be defined recursively as, S(n, k) = k*S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1)

/* A Simple Method to compute nâ€™th Bell Number is to one by one compute S(n, k) for k = 1 to n 
and return sum of all computed values(DP to be used).A BETTER Method is to use "Bell Triangle".
